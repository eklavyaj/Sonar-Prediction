Implementing a single layer neural network on the Sonar dataset.

The whole sonar data set contains 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various conditions. The whole sonar data set contains 97 patterns obtained from rocks under similar conditions. The objective is to predict if the returning signal is from a rock or a mine using a single layer neural network.
